**What is the most import thing in reseach?**
I heard the global company 'Google' have focused on documentation about their research. However, many companies in Korea don't concentrate on this work because of only achiving short-term goal. I think documentation gives me many helps in aspects of career development and self-care. I hope this heart won't be changed.
