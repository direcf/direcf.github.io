## 1. Introduction
#####  3D Represenation

*  Voxel: It seems like that only one dimension adds on 2d vision world, so we can adapt 2d network like CNN as expanding 2d data representation to 3d. However, it has some critical problems like Manhattan world(angle-oriented), Cubic memory problem.
*  Point cloud: It is useful representation for expressing 3d vision world. It is related in lidar sensor and depth camera. Also, it is fast and easy to use. However, point cloud data is unordered, unstructured and no connectivity between other points.
*  Mesh: It is natural, but needs template and self-intersection problem like below picutre.

#####  Point cloud representation problems in detail
<span style="color:#3498DB">number1.</span> Unstructured data : no grid, odd distribution

<span style="color:#3498DB">number2.</span> Invariance to Permutation : if point cloud order changed, matrix also changed
<span style="color:#3498DB">number3.</span> Different number of points
<span style="color:#3498DB">number4.</span> Varying density of points
<span style="color:#3498DB">number5.</span> Interaction among points
<span style="color:#3498DB">number6.</span> Missing data and occlusion
